AnyKernel 2.0 - Flashable Zip Template for Kernel Releases with Ramdisk Modifications
by osm0sis @ xda-developers

// Hacked down to fit the purposes of zen kernel and dynamically add f2fs support + disable forced encryption

// Instructions

1- Place zImage in the root (dtb should also go here for devices that require a custom one, both will fallback to the original if not included)
2- Place any custom init.rc file (like init.zensettings.rc) in files/ and change the variable in anykernel.sh 
3- Modify the anykernel.sh to add your kernel's name, boot partition location, f2fs stuff, etc, etc.
4- zip -r9 UPDATE-AnyKernel2.zip * -x README UPDATE-AnyKernel2.zip

Have fun!
